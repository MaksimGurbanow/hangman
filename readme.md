# Hangman

### Description:
This project was inspired by Rolling Scopes School task [Hangman](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/stage1/tasks/hangman). The game offers limited number of words, which should be guessed. User can read word description and enter letters. If the letter is correct, all letters contained in the current word are revealed, otherwise the part of picture of hangman is drawn. If all parts are drawn, the user lose and receives appropriate message about it. The letters can be entered both by physical keyboard, used on computer and by virtual keyboard, provided by the game.
